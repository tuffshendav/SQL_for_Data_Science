Data Scientist Role Play: Profiling and Analyzing the Yelp Dataset Coursera Worksheet

This is a 2-part assignment. In the first part, you are asked a series of questions that will help you profile and understand the data just like a data scientist would. For this first part of the assignment, you will be assessed both on the correctness of your findings, as well as the code you used to arrive at your answer. You will be graded on how easy your code is to read, so remember to use proper formatting and comments where necessary.

In the second part of the assignment, you are asked to come up with your own inferences and analysis of the data for a particular research question you want to answer. You will be required to prepare the dataset for the analysis you choose to do. As with the first part, you will be graded, in part, on how easy your code is to read, so use proper formatting and comments to illustrate and communicate your intent as required.

For both parts of this assignment, use this "worksheet." It provides all the questions you are being asked, and your job will be to transfer your answers and SQL coding where indicated into this worksheet so that your peers can review your work. You should be able to use any Text Editor (Windows Notepad, Apple TextEdit, Notepad ++, Sublime Text, etc.) to copy and paste your answers. If you are going to use Word or some other page layout application, just be careful to make sure your answers and code are lined appropriately.
In this case, you may want to save as a PDF to ensure your formatting remains intact for you reviewer.



Part 1: Yelp Dataset Profiling and Understanding

1. Profile the data by finding the total number of records for each of the tables below:

SQL Code: 

select count(*)
from (insert each table name here)

from attribute
from business
from category
etc...
	
i. Attribute table = 10000
ii. Business table = 10000
iii. Category table = 10000
iv. Checkin table = 10000
v. elite_years table = 10000
vi. friend table = 10000
vii. hours table = 10000
viii. photo table = 10000
ix. review table = 10000
x. tip table = 10000
xi. user table = 10000
	


2. Find the total distinct records by either the foreign key or primary key for each table. If two foreign keys are listed in the table, please specify which foreign key.

select count(distinct(id))
from business

select count(distinct(business_id))
from hours

select count(distinct(business_id))
from category

etc...

i. Business = 10000
ii. Hours = 1562
iii. Category = 2643
iv. Attribute = 1115
v. Review = (id = 10000), (business_id = 8090), (user_id = 9581)
vi. Checkin = 493
vii. Photo = (id = 10000), (business_id = 6493)
viii. Tip = (business_id = 3979), (user_id = 537)
ix. User = 10000
x. Friend = 11
xi. Elite_years = 2780

Note: Primary Keys are denoted in the ER-Diagram with a yellow key icon.	



3. Are there any columns with null values in the Users table? Indicate "yes," or "no."

4. For each table and column listed below, display the smallest (minimum), largest (maximum), and average (mean) value for the following fields:

select min(column)
from table

select max(column)
from table

select avg(column)

SQL code used to arrive at answer:

select stars,
	sum(review_count) as count
from business
where city = 'Avon'
group by stars	


Copy and Paste the Resulting Table Below (2 columns – star rating and count):

|   4.5 |    31 |
|   5.0 |     3 |
+-------+-------+

ii. Beachwood

SQL code used to arrive at answer:

select stars,
	sum(review_count) as count
from business
where city = 'Beachwood'
group by stars


Copy and Paste the Resulting Table Below (2 columns – star rating and count):

+-------+-------+

|   4.5 |    17 |
|   5.0 |    23 |
+-------+-------+
		


7. Find the top 3 users based on their total number of reviews:
		
	SQL code used to arrive at answer:
	
select name,
review_count
from user
order by review_count desc
limit 3	
	
		
	Copy and Paste the Result Below:
	
+--------+--------------+
| name   | review_count |
+--------+--------------+
| Gerald |         2000 |
| Sara   |         1629 |
| Yuri   |         1339 |
+--------+--------------+
		


8. Does posing more reviews correlate with more fans?

	Please explain your findings and interpretation of the results:

Not necessarily. You can see from the posted data below that the highest fan count has less than a third of the user with the most reviews, 
but nearly doubles that user's fan count.	
	
select name,
review_count,
fans,
yelping_since

Key:
0% - 25% - Low relationship
26% - 75% - Medium relationship
76% - 100% - Strong relationship
	
	SQL code used to arrive at answer:
select name,
	fans,
	useful,
	funny,
	review_count,
	yelping_since
from user

+-----------+------+--------+--------+--------------+---------------------+
	
	
	Please explain your findings and interpretation of the results:
	
	Closer to a medium relationship. Mimi, the second highest fan count is definitely an outlier. William & Fran are some of the highest for useful
	and funny even though they are 8th & 9th in fan count. They're all listed as useful and funny.
	
	
	

Part 2: Inferences and Analysis

1. Pick one city and category of your choice and group the businesses in that city or category by their overall star rating. Compare the businesses with 2-3 stars to the businesses with 4-5 stars and answer the following questions. Include your code.
	
i. Do the two groups you chose to analyze have a different distribution of hours?

Yes, one of the spots seems to be breakfest only and closes way earlier than the other restaurants.

ii. Do the two groups you chose to analyze have a different number of reviews?

Yes
         
         
iii. Are you able to infer anything from the location data provided between these two groups? Explain.

Nothing to infer based on the zip code, but there is a correlation between the amount of time open and the amount of reviews and overall star rating for the restaurants.

SQL code used for analysis:

		select B.name,
			   B.review_count,
			   H.hours,
			   postal_code,
			   case
				  when B.stars between 2 and 3 then '2-3 stars'
				  when B.stars between 4 and 5 then '4-5 stars'
			   end as stars
			   from business B inner join hours H
		on B.id = H.business_id
				inner join category C
		on C.business_id = B.id
		where (B.city = 'Phoenix'
		and
		C.category like 'Restaurants')
		group by stars

		
		
2. Group business based on the ones that are open and the ones that are closed. What differences can you find between the ones that are still open and the ones that are closed? List at least two differences and the SQL code you used to arrive at your answer.
		
i. Difference 1:

Average review count for open businesses is larger than the avg review count of closed ones.
 31.76 open vs 23.20 closed        
         
ii. Difference 2:
 
Average star rating is higher for the open restaurants.

 3.68 open vs 3.52 closed
         
         
SQL code used for analysis:

		select count(DISTINCT(id)),
			   avg(review_count),
			   avg(stars),
			   is_open
		from business
		group by is_open

	
	
3. For this last part of your analysis, you are going to choose the type of analysis you want to conduct on the Yelp dataset and are going to prepare the data for analysis.

Ideas for analysis include: Parsing out keywords and business attributes for sentiment analysis, clustering businesses to find commonalities or anomalies between them, predicting the overall star rating for a business, predicting the number of fans a user will have, and so on. These are just a few examples to get you started, so feel free to be creative and come up with your own problem you want to solve. Provide answers, in-line, to all of the following:
	
i. Indicate the type of analysis you chose to do:

I wanted to analyze what categories drove the highest review count, while also seeing if there was a correlation with the star ratings across categories.
         
ii. Write 1-2 brief paragraphs on the type of data you will need for your analysis and why you chose that data:

To do this I will need to join the business data with the category data to drive the resultig table that will allow me to perform my analysis. I chose to
join these tables because that would allow me to observe which categories drove the highest amount of reviews. I would also be able to observe if there was
a correlation to having multiple categories attached to the business, and how many reviews that could drive. While also being able to observe the star rating 
in relation to the categories.                            
                  
iii. Output of your finished dataset:

+------------------------+----------------------------------------+-------+--------------+------------------------+-------+
| id                     | name                                   | state | review_count | category               | stars |
